This is my first personal project!
Using what I have learned from class, Java and Java Swing, I made an app to simulate blackjack. The closest to 21 without busting wins! I also added a point system that you can bet with. In the future, I might add features like splitting and doubling down.

I chose to make blackjack because I'm familiar with the rules and more importantly, it seemed simple enough for me to be able to make it. I also wanted an easily accessible place for me to play without any real money.
